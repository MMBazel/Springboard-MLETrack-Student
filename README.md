# Springboard ML Eng Career Track

Hi!

My name is Mikiko Bazeley and this is my repo for the Springboard ML Eng Track. 


All of the documentation, code, and notes can be found here, as well as links to other resources I found helpful for successfully completing the program or at [my wiki on Notion](https://www.notion.so/Springboard-Wiki-ML-Engineering-5635fdc85985418caedc16a29682f85e). 

For questions or comments, please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikikobazeley/). 

If you find my repo useful, let me know OR ☕ consider buying me a coffee! https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mmbazel ☕.

Regards,
Mikiko
